# Academy Batches
Academy is a *Learning Expirence* designed by [Empathy.co](https://empathy.co/) to guide students during their transition to work.

It runs three times per year: Winter, Summer and Fall batches. During those batches, the Academy Fellows develop two main projects and a bunch of smaller exercises:

1. Learning Project
2. Proof of Concept Project

To help curious people understand their growth we have develop the current repository. It links their work to a main source of truth.
